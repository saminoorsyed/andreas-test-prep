                <p>After earning my bachelor's degree from the university of California Berkeley in 2013 I began tutoring in San Francisco bay and have since continued to work with young people in the New York, Manhattan area for the last decade.

                <p> Andrea was an amazing tutor to my daughter, even though we initially sought her services for our oldest's test preparation, she has helped both of our children make the most of their highschool careers --Rodger</p>
                <p> My son never complained about doing SAT prep with Andrea, and he complains about EVERYTHING -- Amelia</p>
                <p> Andrea didn't just help me get a 1450 on the SAT, I actually learned that there's a point to learning grammar, and how to do better in my classes at school -- another satisfied customer</p>
