        <h1>Reach out for guidance and preparation for standardized test such as the SAT and ACT to the GRE. I also provide academic mentorship and support</h1>
        <p>After earning my bachelor's degree from the university of California Berkeley in 2013 I began tutoring in San Francisco bay and have since continued to work with young people in the New York, Manhattan area for the last decade. While I am now pursuing my doctorate in Psychology, I remain passionate about helping young people manage the stresses of school and perform throughout their academic career</p>
